The collection of color schemes by Maverick Woo (with some fixes and
additions) for easy playing with [pathogen](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

If you are using a [pathegenized](http://github.com/hariton/pathogenized),
simply add to config something like this:

  - names: ['vimcolors']
    repo: git://github.com/hariton/vimcolors.git
    plugin_type: plugin
    dir: colorthemes

Then  run `~/.vim/bin/update_plugins`

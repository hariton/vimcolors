The collection of color schemes by Maverick Woo (with some fixes and
additions) for easy playing with [pathogen](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

If you are using the [pathegenized](http://github.com/hariton/pathogenized),
simply add to your config something like this:

<pre>
- names: ['vimcolors']
  repo: git://github.com/hariton/vimcolors.git
  plugin_type: plugin
  dir: colorthemes
</pre>

Then run `~/.vim/bin/update_plugins`
